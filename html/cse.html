  Computer Engineering is a discipline that integrates several fields of electrical engineering and computer science required to develop computer hardware and software. 
Computer Engineers usually have training in electronic engineering, software design and hardware-software integration insteadof only software engineering or electronic 
engineering. Computer Engineers are involved in many hardware and software aspects of computing from design of individual microprocessors, personal computers and super
computers to circuit design.
